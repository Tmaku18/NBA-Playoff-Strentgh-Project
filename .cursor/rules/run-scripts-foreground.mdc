# Run scripts in foreground (project)

When the user says **run the script**, **run sweeps**, or **run the pipeline**:

1. **Foreground only** — Run the command in the foreground. Never run long-running scripts in the background.
2. **Let run as long as possible** — Use the longest timeout the tool allows so the run is not cut off early (e.g. 1 hour or more for sweeps; follow plan timeouts for pipeline steps).
3. **Follow the plan** — Use the steps and commands from the relevant plan (e.g. `.cursor/plans/run_full_pipeline_foreground_784ee3ec.plan.md` for pipeline, sweep script for sweeps). Run from project root with PYTHONPATH set; for sweeps use `python -m scripts.sweep_hparams` with the requested options.

If the environment timeout still stops the run before completion, report what completed and give the exact command for the user to run in their terminal to finish.
