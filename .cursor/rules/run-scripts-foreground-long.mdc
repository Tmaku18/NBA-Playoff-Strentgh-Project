# Run pipeline in foreground, never background

Whenever you are **running the pipeline** in this project (e.g. run_full_pipeline, run_pipeline_from_model_a, sweep_hparams, or any training/inference script):

1. **Foreground only** — Never run in background. Do **not** use `is_background: true`. Run in the foreground so the process completes and outputs are captured.
2. **Let it finish** — Use the maximum timeout the run command supports (e.g. 24 hours or the tool limit) so the run is not cut off early. Let it run as long as it needs to finish.
3. **Follow the plan** — Use the relevant plan for working directory, PYTHONPATH, and step order. Run from the project root (worktree or main project as specified).
4. **No chaining** — Prefer a single invocation with correct cwd and env; do not chain with `&&` in PowerShell (use `;` or separate commands if needed).

Example: for the full pipeline, run `python -m scripts.run_pipeline_from_model_a` from the project root with PYTHONPATH set, in the foreground, with the longest allowed timeout.
