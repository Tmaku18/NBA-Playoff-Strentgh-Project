# Run scripts in foreground, as long as possible

When the user asks to **run the script** (e.g. "run sweeps", "run the pipeline", "run sweep_hparams"):

1. **Foreground only** — Run the command in the foreground. Do **not** use background execution (`is_background: true`).
2. **Longest timeout** — Use the maximum timeout the run command supports (e.g. 24 hours or the tool limit) so the run is not cut off early. Let it run as long as possible.
3. **Follow the plan** — Use the relevant plan (e.g. sweep-script-exec, run_full_pipeline_foreground) for working directory, PYTHONPATH, and step order. Run from the project root (worktree or main project as specified).
4. **No chaining** — Prefer a single invocation with correct cwd and env; do not chain with `&&` in PowerShell (use `;` or separate commands if needed).

Example: for sweeps, run `python -m scripts.sweep_hparams ...` from the project root with PYTHONPATH set, in the foreground, with the longest allowed timeout.
