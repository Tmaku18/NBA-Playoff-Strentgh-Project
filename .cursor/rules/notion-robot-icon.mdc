description: Ensure Notion items created/updated for this project use 🤖 icon

# Notion icon convention (project-wide)

Any time you create **or** update anything in Notion that is related to this project (pages, databases, tasks, documents, run logs, plans, file trackers), set the Notion **page icon** to the **🤖** emoji so it is easily recognizable.

## How to apply

- When creating a Notion page/database entry: set its icon to **🤖** at creation time.
- When updating an existing Notion item for this project: if its icon is not **🤖**, change it to **🤖** as part of the same update.

## Notes

- Apply this consistently across all Notion workstreams for this repo (planning, tracking, outputs, documentation, experiments).
- If the Notion integration/tooling you’re using cannot set icons, proceed with the content change but note that the icon could not be set.
